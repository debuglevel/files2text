files2text
==========

files2text is a little C# tool that copies all filenames of a given folder into a text file and renames the changed filenames afterwards.

## Usage

- Choose a directory and click on edit folder
- Your text editor should open with the directory listing
- Edit filenames (use search & replace, regexp, macro's, etc)
- Save the file and close your editor
- A rename preview window should pop up
- Confirm or cancel the displayed changes -> done :)

## Background

As a developer I am used to a text editor, so one day I had the idea to create a tool that would allow me to rename files in my favorite text editor.

## Project status

I'm currently trying to switch from Windows to Linux therefore I'm not sure if I will continue to develop files2text in the future.
So feel free to fork and continue the project.
